# Breathily
Official Code for Breathily Software 

Goal of project is to measure lung function and analyzing breathing patterns by leveraging depth sensors and computer vision. Our aim was to assist patients with nueromusuclar disease (such as ALS) who were unable to properly measure their lung function utilizing traditional measures (such as spirometers) due to their immobility. 

Project ended as of 3/15/2022.
